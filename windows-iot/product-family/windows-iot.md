# An overview of Windows 10 IoT

> [!NOTE]

## What is Windows 10 IoT?
Windows 10 IoT is a member of the Windows 10 family that brings enterprise-class power, security, and manageability to the Internet of Things.  It leverages Windows' embedded experience, ecosystem and cloud connectivity, allowing organizations to create their Internet of Things with secure devices that can be quickly provisioned, easily managed, and seamlessly connected to an overall cloud strategy.  

## Windows 10 IoT Editions
Windows 10 IoT comes in three editions.

1. [Windows 10 IoT Enterprise](../iot-enterprise/Getting_Started.md) is a full version of Windows 10 with specialized features to create dedicated devices locked down to a specific set of applications and peripherals.
2. [Windows Server IoT 2019](../server/windows-server.md) is a full version of Windows Server 2019 that delivers enterprise manageability and security to IoT solutions. 
3. [Windows 10 IoT Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/iot-core/windows-iot-core) is the smallest member of the Windows 10 operating system family. While only running a single app, it still has the manageability and security expected from Windows 10.
