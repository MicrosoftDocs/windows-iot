# Windows Analytics
** Should this be called Desktop Analytics? -> "Desktop Analytics is a successor of Windows Analytics, which retired on January 31, 2020."

Harness the power of Windows Analytics in your Windows 10 IoT Enterprise solution. Some of the popular features are upgrade readiness, [update compliance](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/update-compliance-monitor) and device health.
Upgrade readiness helps you ensure that applications and drivers are ready for a Windows 10 upgrade by also providing troubleshooting guidance, and per-device readiness and tracking details. Update Compliance helps you to keep Windows 10 devices in your organization secure and up to date. Maintaining devices is made easier with Device Health, a new, premium analytic tool that identifies devices and drivers that crash frequently and might need to be rebuilt or replaced.
