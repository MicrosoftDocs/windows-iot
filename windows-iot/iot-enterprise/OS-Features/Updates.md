# Updates
A major advantage of using Window 10 IoT Enterprise is having complete control on windows updates for all your devices. Through [Windows Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/protect/windows-update-settings), you have the ability to configure update settings on devices and to defer update installations. You can also prevent devices from installing features from new Windows versions to help keep them stable, while allowing those devices to continue installing updates for quality and security. Read more about how Windows Intune can help you manage updates [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/protect/windows-update-for-business-configure).
