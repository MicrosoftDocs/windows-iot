# Cloud Connectivity
** Need some more clarification on Cloud Connectivity strategy, are we following the IoT Core path where we are suggesting to users that they use Azure IoT Hub? If so, do we need to create a tutorial, similar to what is found for IoT Core?

IoT solutions are built on cloud computing. The ability to communicate with the cloud and derive insight from the data is an essential part of any IoT project. With Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, migration to the cloud is done easier than ever with the help of [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/).
