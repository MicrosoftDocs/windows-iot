# OEM Customization
Most of our solutions are customized by our OEM partners. OEM software plays a big role in the functionality of the IoT Device. Windows 10 IoT Enterprise supports OEM customization and allows for a custom-built device to be run on top of the operating system.
To assist our OEM customers, we offer [Audit Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/audit-mode-overview) which allows administrators to boot directly to the desktop before you get to the Windows Welcome screen, giving them the opportunity to install Windows Updates, drivers, and other software as needed.
