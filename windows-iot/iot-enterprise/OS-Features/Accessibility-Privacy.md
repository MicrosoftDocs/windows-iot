# Accessibility and Privacy
Windows 10 IoT Enterprise provides users with many accessibility and privacy options and features.

## Accessibility Features
Microsoft is dedicated to making its products and services accessible and usable for everyone.

Windows 10 IoT Enterprise includes accessibility features that can be integrated to further support where [vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/windows-10-accessibility-for-itpros#vision), [hearing](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/windows-10-accessibility-for-itpros#hearing), [physical](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/windows-10-accessibility-for-itpros#physical), [cognition](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/windows-10-accessibility-for-itpros#cognition), along with [assistive technology](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/windows-10-accessibility-for-itpros#assistive-technology-devices-built-into-windows-10) is needed. This additional support makes it easier to customize devices and gives users with different abilities options to improve their experience with Windows.

To learn more about accessibility, please read [Accessibility Information for IT Professionals](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/windows-10-accessibility-for-itpros), and [Windows Accessibility](https://www.microsoft.com/Accessibility/windows?rtc=1&activetab=pivot_1%3aprimaryr2)

### General Recommendations
* **Be aware of Ease of Access settings** – Understand how these devices are being used. Help people in your organization learn how they can customize Windows 10.
* **Do not block settings** – Avoid using Group Policy or MDM settings that override Ease of Access settings.
* **Encourage choice** – Allow for device customization based upon needs. That might mean installing an add-on for a browser, or a non-Microsoft assistive technology.

## Privacy Features
Microsoft will maintain the timeless value of privacy and preserve the ability for you to control your data.

With Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, we provide you with even more control on your data and information. Please review, [Windows 10 & Privacy Compliance:
A Guide for IT and Compliance Professionals](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/windows-10-and-privacy-compliance) for more features.

Under privacy settings, you can now delete the diagnostic data your device has sent to Microsoft. You can also view this diagnostic data using the [Diagnostic Data Viewer](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/diagnostic-data-viewer-overview) application. Check out [Windows 10 & Privacy Compliance: A Guide for IT and Compliance Professionals](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/windows-10-and-privacy-compliance) for more privacy features.

Please review [Windows Privacy](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/), and [Microsoft's Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) if you have any questions or concerns.
