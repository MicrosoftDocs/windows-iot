# Privacy
Windows 10 IoT Enterprise provides users with many privacy options and features.

## Privacy Features
With Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, we provide you with even more control on your data and information. Please review, [Windows 10 & Privacy Compliance:
A Guide for IT and Compliance Professionals](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/windows-10-and-privacy-compliance) for more features.

## Manage your Data
Under privacy settings, you can now delete the diagnostic data your device has sent to Microsoft. You can also view this diagnostic data using the [Diagnostic Data Viewer](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/diagnostic-data-viewer-overview) application.

## End-User Privacy Policy Standard
In some cases, you may configure default settings and features on your customer system on behalf of the end-user.

However, if you turn on these settings and features by default or if diagnostics are above the basic setting, you must:

* Notify the end-user that these features have been enabled, and provide the end-user with the link to [Microsoft's Privacy Statement web page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839).
* Secure consent from the relevant end user to enable such features by default (as required by applicable law).
* Provide end-users the ability to change the Diagnostics setting back to the basic setting.
* If you enable Microsoft Accounts and you have access to end-user data, if the end user deletes the Microsoft Account, you must enable simultaneous deletion of all the end -user's Microsoft Account data on the device.


## Additional Resources
* [Windows Privacy](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/)
