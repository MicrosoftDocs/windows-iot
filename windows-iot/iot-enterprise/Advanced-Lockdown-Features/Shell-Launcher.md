# Shell Launcher
Using [Shell Launcher](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/kiosk-shelllauncher), you can configure a kiosk device to run a Windows Desktop or Universal Windows Application as the user interface. The application that you specify replaces the default shell (explorer.exe) that usually runs when a user logs on. This type of single-app kiosk does not run above the lock screen. Methods of controlling access to other desktop applications and system components can be used in addition to using the Shell Launcher such as, [group policy](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=25250), [AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/iot-enterprise/advanced_lockdown_features#applocker) and [mobile device management](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/)
