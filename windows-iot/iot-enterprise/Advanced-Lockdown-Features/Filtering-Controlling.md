# Filtering and Controlling (USB Access)
One of the most important safeguards that can be implemented against device tampering, whether that be malware infections or data loss, is restricting USB drives and other peripherals from gaining access to your device. Windows 10 IoT Enterprise gives you the power to set policies to [restrict or allow removable devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/device-control/control-usb-devices-using-intune#allow-or-block-removable-devices), [prevent threats from removable storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/device-control/control-usb-devices-using-intune#prevent-threats-from-removable-storage), create [customized alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/device-control/control-usb-devices-using-intune#create-customized-alerts-and-response-actions) and response actions to monitor usage of removable devices and even [respond to threats](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/device-control/control-usb-devices-using-intune#respond-to-threats) in real-time.

Here's a [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/bb530324(v=msdn.10)) on how to control device installation using group policy.
