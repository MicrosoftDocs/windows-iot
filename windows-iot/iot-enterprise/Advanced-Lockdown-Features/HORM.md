# Hibernate Once/Resume Many (HORM)
You can use the [Hibernate Once/Resume Many (HORM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/hibernate-once-resume-many-horm-) feature with [Unified Write Filter (UWF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/iot-enterprise/advanced_lockdown_features#unifiedwritefilter) to start your device in a preconfigured state. When HORM is enabled, your system always resumes and restarts from the last saved hibernation file. A device with HORM enabled can quickly be turned off or shut down, and then restarted into the preconfigured state, even in the event of a sudden power loss. To configure the UMF with HORM, check out this [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/hibernate-once-resume-many-horm-#configure-horm).
