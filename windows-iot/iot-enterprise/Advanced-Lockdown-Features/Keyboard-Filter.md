# Keyboard Filter
If your device is being use for a dedicated purpose, it may make sense to ensure that key combinations like 'Ctrl+Alt+Delete' do not alter the operation of the device by locking the screen or using Task Manager to close a running application. Windows 10 IoT Enterprise provides a feature called [Keyboard Filter](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/keyboardfilter#:~:text=Keyboard%20Filter.%20You%20can%20use%20Keyboard%20Filter%20to,using%20Task%20Manager%20to%20close%20a%20running%20application.) that allows you to suppress undesirable key presses or key combinations. This [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/keyboardfilter#turn-on-keyboard-filter) will be able to walk you through how to configure, enable or disable the feature to meet your needs.
