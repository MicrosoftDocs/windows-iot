# Secondary Microsoft Edge Tiles
In Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, you have the ability to configure secondary app tiles to create a customized user experience. Primary app tiles are the Start screen tiles that represent and launch an app. A tile that allows a user to go to a specific location in an app is a called secondary tile. Some examples of secondary tiles include: weather updates for a specific city in a weather app, a summary of upcoming events in a calendar app, status and updates from an important contact in a social app or a specific website in Microsoft Edge. For example, you can create secondary tiles for Microsoft Edge that display a custom image, rather than a tile with the standard Microsoft Edge logo in the Start layout enabling you to further brand the user experience.
