# Layout Control

## Start and Taskbar Layout Control
In Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, organizations can deploy a [customized Start and Taskbar](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/windows-10-start-layout-options-and-policies) configuration to their devices. A standard, customized [Start layout](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/customize-and-export-start-layout) can be useful on devices that are common to multiple users and devices that are locked down for specialized purposes. Configuring the [taskbar layout](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/configure-windows-10-taskbar) allows the organization to pin useful apps for their employees and to remove apps that are pinned by default to provide a specified user experience.
