# Update Notification
In Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, we know that having your device ready for use at all time is very important. We have many features to help you maximize control over your devices' [update notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-wu-settings#remove-access-to-use-all-windows-update-features) to ensure that you can plan and ahead and control when updates can occur. You can use Group Policy settings, or mobile device management (MDM) to configure when devices will restart after a Windows 10 update is installed. You can schedule update installation and set policies for restart, configure active hours for when restarts will not occur, or you can do both so the user never has to see a notification about an upcoming Windows Update.
