# Page Visibility

## Settings Policy: Page Visibility
In Windows 10 IoT there are many [settings policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-settings) that can be set. One settings policy that is quite useful is configuring [page visibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-settings#settings-pagevisibilitylist). This feature allows you to prevent specific pages in the System Settings app from being visible or accessible, or to do so for all pages except those specified.
