# Unbranded Boot
You can suppress Windows elements that appear when Windows starts or resumes and can suppress the crash screen when Windows encounters an error that it cannot recover from. This feature is known as [Unbranded Boot](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/unbranded-boot). This feature allows you to customize and control the user experience during transitions.
