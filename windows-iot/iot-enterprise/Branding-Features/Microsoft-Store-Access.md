## Microsoft Store Access
Access to the Microsoft store can be blocked either to meet requirements for an organization's policy or to achieve a desired customer experience in Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. You have the option to block access to the Microsoft Store through configuring the settings through [AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/stop-employees-from-using-microsoft-store#block-microsoft-store-using-applocker), or adding a [Group Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/stop-employees-from-using-microsoft-store#block-microsoft-store-using-group-policy).
