# Getting Started with Windows 10 IoT Enterprise
This article will give you an overview of the product and guide you through how to get started with Windows 10 IoT Enterprise.

## What is Windows 10 IoT Enterprise?
Windows 10 IoT Enterprise is a full version of Windows 10 that delivers enterprise manageability and security to IoT solutions. Windows 10 IoT Enterprise shares all the benefits of the worldwide Windows ecosystem. It is a binary equivalent to Windows 10 Enterprise, so you can use the same familiar development and management tools as client PCs and laptops. However, when it comes to licensing and distribution, the desktop version and IoT versions differ. Note that Windows 10 IoT Enterprise offers both LTSC and SAC options, and OEMs can choose the one they need for their devices. Please review [licensing](./Commercialization/Licensing.md) for more details.
