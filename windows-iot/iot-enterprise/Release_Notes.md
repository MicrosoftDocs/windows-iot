# Release Notes
Each Windows 10 IoT Enterprise release offers our latest features, including specific updates made to address customer requests. One of the most obvious benefits of migrating to Windows 10 IoT Enterprise is the continuous value add you’re always getting. As you can see, with each release, Windows just gets better and better.  

>[!NOTE]
> We are highlighting some of the more prominent new features that have come out in each release of Windows 10 IoT Enterprise – this doesn’t include every new feature, nor does it in include the continuous improvements and enhancements we make to the existing features in the product with each release.  

With the 1903 release, we have created a new edition for Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. In the future, it can unlock IoT scenarios with a tailored feature set. As of the 1903 & 1909 releases, the sole difference between the Desktop and IoT versions is that reserved storage for updates and temporary files isn’t set aside during installation; this allows for the use of smaller storage devices with an identical feature set. Also, with the new keys, the edition will now show up as Windows 10 IoT Enterprise​.
