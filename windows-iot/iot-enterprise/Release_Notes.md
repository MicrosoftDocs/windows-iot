# Release Notes


With the 1903 release, we have created a new edition for Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. In the future, it can unlock IoT scenarios with a tailored feature set. As of the 1903 & 1909 releases, the sole difference between the Desktop and IoT versions is that reserved storage for updates and temporary files isn’t set aside during installation; this allows for the use of smaller storage devices with an identical feature set. Also, with the new keys, the edition will now show up as Windows 10 IoT Enterprise​.
