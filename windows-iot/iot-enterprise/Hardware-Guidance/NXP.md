# Windows 10 IoT Enterprise and NXP i.MX SoCs
NXP supports the Windows 10 IoT Enterprise through open-source BSPs on i.MX applications processors and featured development boards. NXP has made the board support packages (BSPs) for i.MX 8M family of SoCs available for commercial use. The highly optimized Windows 10 IoT Enterprise BSPs on i.MX applications platforms make it easier to build secure, scalable solutions from device to cloud, ranging from provisioning to managing and securing devices at scale. Designers can easily run cloud services and gain insights from IoT devices. Windows 10 IoT Enterprise on i.MX applications Processors provides faster time to market with many included user interfaces and device stacks that works out of the box.

## BSP Access
If you are interested to enable commercial support for your own i/MX hardware, please access the BSP source and documentation on [NXP's website](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/embedded-software/windows-10-iotIf-core-for-i.mx-applications-processors:IMXWIN10IOT).

If you have NXP hardware/BSP related questions or feedback on how the BSP can better support your targeted solution, please post to the [NXP Community](https://community.nxp.com/community/imx/content?filterID=contentstatus%5Bpublished%5D%7Ecategory%5Bwindows%5D). For any Windows-related questions, please use the [Microsoft Community](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/home?forum=WindowsIoT).

If you need additional support beyond the community forums for BSP customization and integration for i.MX products, support is available via [Pro-Support](www.nxp.com/prosupport). Inquiries can be sent to [prosupport@nxp.com](mailto:prosupport@nxp.com). For Windows 10 IoT paid services and integration, please contact [epsoinfo@microsoft.com](mailto:epsoinfo@microsoft.com).

## Ecosystem Resources

Several Microsoft and NXP partners have enabled Windows 10 IoT Enterprise on commercial i.MX 8M devices. Please contact the partner directly for hardware access.
